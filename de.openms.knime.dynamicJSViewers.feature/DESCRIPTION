This package was developed as part of the MODAL project and adds JavaScript
visualizations for mass-spectrometry data to KNIME.
It is intended to be used together with the KNIME OpenMS plugin.
OpenMS is an open-source software C++ library for LC/MS data management and 
analyses. It offers an infrastructure for the development of mass 
spectrometry related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization.
